    <h4>Prime cost</h4>
    <br>
        
        <h3> Are direct materials and direct labor. These costs are directly related to production. For example, the cost of labor (doctors, nurses, etc.) and direct materials (examination and treatment) Amount of direct material and direct labor involved in the manufacture of a product.
        The primary cost is the result of adding the raw material and the cost of direct labor. In the industrial companies, to determine the cost of production it is necessary to elaborate a state of costs, in which expenditures are considered as raw material and direct labor, factors that together are known as prime cost, which is one of the parts of the cost statement. To produce a good or merchandise, the company requires the purchase of raw materials, which it will then transform into a final product. </h3>

        <h4>Production costs</h4>
        <br>
        
        <h3>
        Production costs are monetary estimates of all expenses that have been made within the company, for the development of a good. These expenses include everything related to labor, costs of materials, as well as all indirect costs that in some way contribute to the manufacture of a good.</h3>
        <br><br>

        <h4>Indirect cost</h4>
        <br>
            
        <h3>The costs represent all those expenses incurred by a company as a result of the exercise of its economic activity, expenses that are inherent to the development and production of goods and services offered to the end customer.</h3>
        <br><br>
        
        <h4>Production costs</h4>
     <br>
        
        <h3>
        Production costs (also called operating costs) are the expenses necessary to maintain a project, processing line or equipment in operation. In a standard company, the difference between income (from sales and other inputs) and the cost of production indicates gross profit.</h3>
        <br><br>
        
        <h4>Operation cost</h4>
    <br>
        
        <h3>They are the expenses associated with the operation of a company on a day-to-day basis. Expenses include all costs to operate, but in general they can be divided into two main categories: maintenance and administration. Maintenance costs are more related to the product (manufacturing, maintenance and improvements), while administration costs are related to documentation and employees (payroll, accounting and bank charges, office rental, etc.). In addition, your operating costs can be divided into other categories of trailer: fixed costs and variable costs. Your costs and repair costs do not change regardless of how your business is performing or the amount of product you are selling. An example of a fixed cost is rent, no matter how much of your product you have sold in a given month, the rent will remain the same. A variable cost is a cost that is subject to change depending on the performance of the business. An example of variable cost is payroll: if your company is selling 5 times the amount of product as it did before, you may need to hire more employees to deal with new customers, so payroll spending increases with strong commercial performance . In general, it is important to keep operating costs low and calculate your operating cost so that you know how much revenue your business needs to be profitable.</h3>
